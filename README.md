# Monster Sanctuary Archipelago Client
This is a client mod for Monster Sanctuary that makes it compatible with the Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer.

This mod features randomization for all items and monsters through Archipelago.

NOTE: This mod is currently in its alpha stage. Features are likely to be broken and there will be bugs. The fastest way to report bugs is to message me (Saagael) directly on Discord, though anyone is welcome to add issues here on github. If you can, include a screenshot of the problem as well as any error messages in the console.
